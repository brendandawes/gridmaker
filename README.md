Grid Maker
----------

This is a little thing I made in Processing to generate grids for Notes to Myself.

A sine wave is used to vary the grids across the page, with each line locking to a baseline of 24 pixels, which is about 3mm when printed. Playing with the sliders alters the layout. Click 'Save PDF' to export a timestamped pdf.

Requires [Processing](http://processing.org) as well as a few other libraries as detailed in the code.
